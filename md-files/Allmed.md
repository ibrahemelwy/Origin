# Allmed Project
## 1st Assesment
### Verification Sensor P2
- Needed to be Selected and select it's place
### Main Problem Provided Through Osama
  - Vibration During Printing Because of the Length of the Bracket VS Print
### Main Problem Provided by Omar
-  Printer : Vibration during Printing Osama
-  Signals : 1 Signal From Archa to the printing at fixed speed  TO SSR
              1 Signal from Archa's in to Triggering to Beagle from sick sensor NPN
## Note : Software Should Use Falling Edge Not Rising Edge
-  no lens fixtations lens needed to be replaced
-  Arch Using track & trace On Program 3
-  WOD Of Camera , Inclination of Camera , Fish Eye
-  light Position : Normal Fixitation OF Lighting .  
- WiRing Digram : NO Wire Tags .
-  Raw Wiring Provided By Omar El Naghy

### Site Results For 22th july
- 1st the focus was needed to be adjusted ==> done
- lens fixed Using Wire Tape ==> done
- WOD is good as it needs to focus only on the spot of printing
- Exposure Time Was 1500 which is to high so i reduced it to 550
- Wrinkle Problem needs to be adjusted
- double Trigger in case of Bottle in Fig A
- SN refuse even after Reading Data-Matrix After Contact hitham He told Me that this is because of the captured serial doesn't exist in camera qeue or because of double Trigger
- For now T&T System is good from the basic concept But needs the previuos adjustment to be ready for Validtation
- Hithams 1st Software Had abug that after Capture the image no ROI defined on the Image so It's Reject So I had To return to the old backup And Wait for Hithams new Software
## Tools Needed For 24th July
- CounterBit Stepped down
- Drill
- Allen-keys
- Soldering Iron
- Solder
### Site Results For 24 JULY
- Sliding Plate For Printer "Fixed"
- Reject Verification Senesor needs to be soldered to the plug 'fixitaion is iin process'
- 1st Error Happened Due To unclean Belt So I asked To clean the belt percetage for now 8 : 2 which means 20%
- ink used were P26 this Could be main issu of ink Difussing
- ink P0 is not Good
- after Returning to the P26 Print Start To be Good Again
- a slight shifting started to Appear After Checking i found that the Belt is Not Well Cleaned So I asked them to Clean It Again
- Cleaning For the 3rd Time Act AS main Problem
- the Error of diffusing ink Was Because of that the Label Was In Contact With the Slider So I tried Out to Adjust the Printer Again For Now It's Good Waiting the Cleaning To start a patch of 100 Bottle Continous  
- we started to use a fine Sand-paper To Clean the Belt as the Iso With the Iron Brush is Not Good
- Haitham Software Without Buffer Is Working Fine Till NOw NOthingh Appeared
- Last Run Worked Fine With a Percentage Of 84.4: 15.6 With actual Bottels Of 92 : 17
- For Now I'm Waiting the Second Patch TO Get from the Auto-clave So As To I Could Start the Second Run With ASAS Number Of Bottels
- working with the bottels at the very hot State "Just Recieved From the Auto ClaV"is not Good
- Now I Found A Asynchronization Between Arca & Zen Jet so I should Start To Work On
- the succseful Test That I ASsumed that the Diff. is 0.5M/min from arca to zen-jet so I set Arca at 20 M/min and Zen-jet 19.5 M/min With Belt Inverter On A set point of  34.1 Which Gave Me Accurate Position For about 75 Consecutive Good Bottels.
### Site Results For 4 Augest
  - RJV Sensor Has Fixed the Eye Porus Opened for the Sensor need To Be Bigger
  - triggering problem Because of the Encoder Double Checked the Wires To Make Sure No AC Wires alonge the encoder Wire
  - Arca Speed Decreased From 20m/min to 19m/min to overcome the wrinkels
  - Forget to decrease the speed in the printer "Needed to be done 1st thing tomorrow morning"
### Prepartions needed for 5 Aug
  - Getting Encoders From Omar el naghy
  - charge the Drill
  - Ask Haitham for Encoder ticks at Software
  - ask Haitham for RJV Revise RJV @ RT Firmware
### Plane For 5 Aug
- Retest the Encoder Used Yesterday
- if Encoder Fails Will Replace the encoder with new one with low Precsion Tiks 150 Tick
- if the low Precsion encoder fail will Replace Them With a Reajet Encoder With HIgh Precsion Ticks 5000 Tick "Not Recomended"
- working on getting the Camera As Close AS Possible from Arca So that i can decrease the Qeue "Will Decrease the Reject Percentage due to printing errors"
- test a consequtive  500 Bottle with no stops
- download the software taken from lotfy & Haitham and Don't forget to add "tick_mm" VARRCHAR(45) column in "rt_config" table in DB
