### Site Results For 22th july 
- 1st the focus was needed to be adjusted ==> done 
- lens fixed Using Wire Tape ==> done 
- WOD is good as it needs to focus only on the spot of printing 
- Exposure Time Was 1500 which is to high so i reduced it to 550
- Wrinkle Problem needs to be adjusted 
- double Trigger in case of Bottle in Fig A 
- SN refuse even after Reading Data-Matrix After Contact hitham He told Me that this is because of the captured serial doesn't exist in camera qeue or because of double Trigger 
- For now T&T System is good from the basic concept But needs the previuos adjustment to be ready for Validtation 
- Hithams 1st Software Had abug that after Capture the image no ROI defined on the Image so It's Reject So I had To return to the old backup And Wait for Hithams new Software
